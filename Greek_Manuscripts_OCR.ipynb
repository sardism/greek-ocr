    "🏛️ Greek Manuscript OCR: Memory-Efficient Extraction\n",
    "This cell handles the core transformation of the scanned document into digital text. It is designed with an Efficiency Architect approach to solve two specific problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Bottlenecks: Instead of loading a 300+ page PDF into RAM, it uses a generator-like approach to process one page at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic Accuracy: It leverages the Tesseract ell (Greek) language pack to correctly identify complex characters in scanned manuscripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠️ Execution Logic\n",
    "Interactive Selection: Opens a native file explorer for input/output paths to avoid hardcoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequential Processing: Uses first_page and last_page parameters in convert_from_path to ensure the CPU only handles one high-resolution (300 DPI) image at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incremental Saving: Writes each page to a unique .txt file immediately. This ensures that if the process is interrupted, progress is preserved."
